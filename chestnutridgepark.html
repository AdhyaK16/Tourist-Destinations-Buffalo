The casino is open year round with a fireplace and food concession stand not to mention the scenic overview. There are many great outdoor activities to experience in all seasons. In addition, you can visit the Rock Garden with its decorative shrubbery and stop by the memorial too. There is an outdoor athletic sports field and family picnic grills. Open year round. There are many great outdoor activities to experience in all seasons. There is an outdoor athletic sports field as well as family picnic grills. A little-known section of the park is the southwest portion, sometimes referred to as the “Shale Creek Preserve.” It is within this remote section that nature is at its finest, with its seemingly primitive wooded ravines and a most unique natural feature, the “Eternal Flame Falls.” The main lodge located at the top of the sledding hill contains park information, picnic tables, vending machines, and a café. Multiple cafés have opened and closed in the lodge, one being The Grateful Grind, which opened late December of 2018, serving breakfast foods until it closed in August of 2023.[6] The current café, The Lodge, was opened in 2023 and currently serves concession food. The main lodge also has a tower viewer looking north, giving views of Highmark Stadium, the city of Buffalo, and on a clear day, Niagara Falls and the Canada–United States border. </p>

<p>Chestnut Ridge Park is a 1,213-acre (4.91 km2) park in Orchard Park, New York, originally named for the chestnut trees on its hills. It is currently the largest park operated by the Erie County Department of Parks, Recreation and Forestry, and is open year-round. The park has facilities and space for tennis, hiking, disc golf, snowmobiling, sledding and other outdoor activities. The Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra has held summer concerts at the base of the sledding hill, which provides an amphitheater-like setting. On a clear day, the sledding hill offers views of Buffalo and Lake Erie. Toboggan chutes also operate on the sled hill during the winter. The Eternal Flame Falls, a small waterfall containing a natural "eternal flame," is located within the park. The falls are situated within what was once known as the Shale Creek Preserve, a wilderness area formerly owned by the Buffalo Museum of Science. A tower facility used for firefighter training is located on the premises.</p>
